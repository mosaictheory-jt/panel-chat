Large organizations will spend 10’s of millions in labor and system costs each year (BU’s each doing their own thing) while also having so much data sprawl that senior leadership teams struggle being data driven at the top. There is also a component of corporate alignment missing as well where data modeling and system design practices tend to follow org structure and culture - this is directly tied to data sprawl. However organizations can fix data sprawl by having a data-modeling-first strategy with senior leadership support (C suite and senior VP’s). This will help break down silos even when org structure naturally supports them (such as orgs built based on acquisitions).,United States / Canada

Often, requests come in as simple data movement tasks, but technical skills alone aren't enough to guarantee reliability. To build trust, engineers need domain training just as much as they need technical specs. Without understanding the business context, we can only check for generic errors (like null values or record count checks).

When we are trained in the domain, we can write business-specific Data Quality tests and robust reconciliation logic, ensuring that data doesn't just 'load' successfully, but actually matches the reality across source and target systems. Investing in this domain knowledge transforms us from utility providers into strategic partners who ensure data integrity.",Asia–Pacific

So in that light, Data Lineage and importance of your data being able to express the business accurately. There's so much stateless tribal institutional information not captured in the data. Good Data Models, then simple things like understanding how columns of data, even simply it's cardinality for instance, can really make or break the ""expression"" of that data. We need more thoughtfulness in how we express and capture data in the data models.",United States / Canada
